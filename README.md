# Bloks

An opinionated smart contract library for onchain operations.

## Base contracts

- `[####-] 80%` `Allowlist`: General address allowlists with customizable list names.
- `[####-] 80%` `AllowlistEnumerable`: `Allowlist` with full enumerability without indexers.
- `[##---] 40%` `Signable2Step`: Single signer with required 2-step rotation process.

## Install

```bash
forge install ilikesymmetry/bloks
```

> **Note**: It is recommended to NOT use a remapping so that you can also intuitively import mocks within the `test/` directory.
